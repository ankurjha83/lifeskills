I stormed into the school library, my heart racing and my fists clenched. Today was supposed to be a good day, but it was quickly turning into a disaster. I headed straight for the cozy reading nook in the corner, where I knew I would find my friend Kabir.

As I approached, I could see Kabir holding a book in his hands, a mischievous grin on his face. My eyes narrowed as I realized what book it was - the one I had been waiting to borrow for weeks, the one I had been dreaming about reading every night before bed.

"Kabir, that's my book!" I exclaimed, my voice rising in frustration. "I saw it first, and I have been waiting to read it for so long. How could you just take it like that?"

Kabir looked up at me, his grin fading into a frown. "I didn't see your name on it, Aarav. Besides, I saw it first today, and I really want to read it too. Can't we just share it?"

Share it? How could we possibly share a book that I had been longing to read for so long? My emotions were all over the place - anger, disappointment, and a twinge of jealousy all mixed together in a messy whirlwind inside me.

"I don't want to share, Kabir. I want to read it all by myself," I said stubbornly, crossing my arms over my chest.

Kabir sighed, looking conflicted. "But Aarav, we're friends. Friends are supposed to share things and take turns. Can't we figure out a way to read it together?"

I could feel my frustration bubbling over, my cheeks flushing with anger. Why did everything have to be so complicated? Why couldn't I just have the book all to myself like I had planned?

But as I looked into Kabir's earnest eyes, I realized that maybe he had a point. Maybe sharing wasn't so bad after all. Maybe it was even better to enjoy a book together with a friend, to talk about it and laugh at the funny parts together.

Taking a deep breath, I finally relented. "Okay, Kabir. Let's share the book. But only if we promise to read it together and talk about it afterwards."

Kabir's face lit up with a smile, relief evident in his eyes. "Deal, Aarav. Thanks for being understanding. I promise we'll have a great time reading it together."

And as we settled down in the cozy reading nook, side by side, I felt a warm glow of friendship and understanding wash over me. Maybe sharing wasn't so bad after all. Maybe it was even better.
