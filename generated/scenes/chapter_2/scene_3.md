As I entered my sister's room, my eyes widened at the sight of all the sparkly makeup and costume jewelry scattered around. I had never been in here before, and it felt like a magical wonderland filled with glitter and colors.

My sister, Riya, grinned mischievously as she held up a bright pink feather boa. "Aarav, do you want a makeover?" she asked, her eyes twinkling with excitement.

I couldn't resist the invitation. "Sure, why not?" I replied, trying to sound nonchalant even though I was thrilled at the idea of a makeover.

Riya wasted no time in getting to work. She handed me a mirror and started applying bright blue eyeshadow to my eyelids. I couldn't help but giggle at the ticklish feeling of the brush against my skin.

Next, she pulled out a tube of bright red lipstick and carefully applied it to my lips. I puckered up like a fish, making Riya burst into giggles.

As she rummaged through her collection of accessories, Riya picked out a pair of oversized sunglasses and a fluffy pink feathered hat. She placed them on my head and declared, "You look fabulous, Aarav!"

I couldn't stop laughing as I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror. With my blue eyeshadow, red lips, oversized sunglasses, and fluffy hat, I looked like a mix between a clown and a movie star.

Riya and I spent the next hour experimenting with different makeup looks and trying on various accessories. We laughed until our stomachs hurt, and I forgot all about my failed volcano project.

In that moment, I realized that it was okay to let go of my frustrations and have fun. Sometimes, all it took was a goofy makeover session with my sister to brighten my mood and make me forget about my troubles.

As I wiped off the last traces of makeup from my face, I hugged Riya tightly. "Thanks for the makeover, sis," I said, grinning from ear to ear. "I feel like a new person!"

And with that, I left Riya's room feeling lighter and happier, ready to face whatever challenges came my way.
