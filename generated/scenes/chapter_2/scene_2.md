I couldn't contain my excitement as I worked on my volcano project in the backyard. The sun was shining, the birds were chirping, and everything was going perfectly. I carefully poured the baking soda into the bottle, added red food coloring for that lava effect, and mixed in some vinegar. I knew that the moment of eruption was near.

But just as I was about to add the final ingredient, a gust of wind swept through the backyard, causing my volcano to erupt prematurely. Red foam spewed out of the bottle and splattered all over the grass. I couldn't believe it. My masterpiece was ruined.

I felt a surge of frustration building up inside me. Why did the wind have to ruin everything? I had worked so hard on this project, and now it was all for nothing. I let out a loud groan, kicking at the grass in anger.

My mom, who was watching from the kitchen window, came rushing out to see what had happened. "Aarav, what's wrong?" she asked, concern etched on her face.

"My volcano erupted too soon because of the stupid wind!" I exclaimed, pointing angrily at the mess on the grass.

Mom knelt down beside me and put a comforting hand on my shoulder. "I know you're upset, Aarav. It's frustrating when things don't go as planned. But remember, it's okay to feel angry or disappointed. What's important is how you handle those feelings."

I took a deep breath, trying to calm myself down. Mom was right. It was okay to feel frustrated, but I didn't have to let it ruin my day. I looked at the mess in front of me and thought about what I could do to salvage the project.

After a moment of thinking, I grabbed a shovel from the shed and started scooping up the foam from the grass. Mom joined in, helping me clean up the mess. As we worked together, I felt my frustration slowly melting away.

By the time we were done, the backyard was back to its pristine state. Mom gave me a proud smile and said, "See, Aarav? You handled your big feelings really well. I'm proud of you."

I grinned back at her, feeling a sense of accomplishment. Even though my volcano had erupted prematurely, I had learned an important lesson about handling my emotions. And next time, I would make sure to choose a less windy day for my next experiment.
